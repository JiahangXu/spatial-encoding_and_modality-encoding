Few-shot Learning for Cardiac Segmentation via Self-supervised Multi-task Learning

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose two novel self-supervised tasks, which encode the spatial 
and modality appearance information of cardiac images, respectively. Furthermore, we propose
to ensemble multiple self-supervised tasks in a multi-task learning framework to learn more
effective semantic representation for cardiac segmentation. The proposed approach was validated 
on the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images from the 
public MICCAI 2019 MSCMRseg Dataset, and was compared with two popular self-supervised tasks, 
including context inpainting (CI) and context restoration (CR). Results demonstrated that the 
proposed self-supervised tasks, as well as hybridized multi-task learning strategies, are 
effective in few-shot cardiac segmentation.
